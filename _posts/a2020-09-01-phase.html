Phase was one of my first attempts at making a small game prototype in Unity.

<p>
The art style was mostly inspired by Hyper Light Drifter by Heart Machine. The project was good practice for learning to
make sprites and animations using Aseprite. I made the following character for it with some basic animations,
which I'm still very happy with:
</p>

<!-- <div class="row">
    <div class="column">
      <img src="assets/images/Phase/preview-image.gif" alt="Snow" style="width:100%">
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <img src="assets/images/Phase/preview-image.gif" alt="Forest" style="width:100%">
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <img src="assets/images/Phase/preview-image.gif" alt="Mountains" style="width:100%">
    </div>
  </div> -->

<p>
At the core of the game would be a movement controller that would allow the player to keep their momentum. For this I
wrote a "stepwise" movement controller, which would increase the speed of the player step by step. Internally this
worked using an FSM with a bunch of curves to control the velocity profile at each step:
</p>

<p>
Had I continued with this I think I would have made the steps "snappier", really giving the player a jolt with each step
to emphasize the movement and adding some animations (though I think the idea was that you would collect abilities over
time, and that would have been one of the first few abilities).

I also put a lot of work into the autotile system, writing a series of tools to create maps. This included tools to
import "blob" type tile sheets and automatically generate the autotiles with named prefixes. I then wrote a series of
brushes that would used the generated tilesets to allow automatic drawing of rooms with walls:

<p>
On top of that I added an animation system where some tiles would play an animation every so often. This was done by
letting an animation manager component on the tilemap replace static tiles with their animated variants.
